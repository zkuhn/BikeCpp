# BikeCpp

This small project is for a coding problem to identify a pose of a three wheeled robot after reading 
sensor data about wheel ticks and steering angle.

The three wheel tricyle is simplified to two wheeled bicycle kinematics.

A Makefile will build and run a test class as the regular main function, 
or make test will run GoogleTest test cases.
